### Project Name: Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Product Reviews


### 1. Data Collection
- Obtained Amazon product review datasets, including text reviews and ratings.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed the distribution of ratings and review lengths.
- Visualized word frequency and sentiment distributions.

### 3. Data Preprocessing
- Performed text cleaning:
  - Removed stop words, punctuation, and special characters.
  - Tokenized and lemmatized text.
- Encoded sentiment labels for classification.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.

### 4. Model Development
- Implemented machine learning models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Naive Bayes
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Random Forests
- Experimented with deep learning models like LSTMs and Transformers (e.g., BERT).
- Tuned hyperparameters using grid search and cross-validation.

### 5. Model Evaluation
- Evaluated models on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
- Selected the best-performing model for deployment.

### 6. Insights and Visualization
- Identified key words and phrases associated with positive and negative sentiments.
- Visualized sentiment trends over time and by product category.
